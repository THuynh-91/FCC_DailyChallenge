# Array Swap
## Prompt

Given an array with two values, return an array with the values swapped.

For example, given ["A", "B"] return ["B", "A"].

## My Thoughts
There wasn't much to unpack here, we return the reversed version of the given array.

## Solution (Python)
```python
def array_swap(arr):
    return arr[::-1]
```
