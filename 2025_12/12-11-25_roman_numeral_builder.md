## Prompt

Given an integer, return its equivalent value in Roman numerals.

Roman numerals are written from largest to smallest, left to right using the following rules:

-   Addition is used when a symbol is followed by one of equal or smaller value. For example,  `18`  is written as  `XVIII`  (10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18).
-   Subtraction is used when a smaller symbol appears before a larger one, to represent 4 or 9 in any place value. For example, 19 is written as  `XIX`  (10 + (10 - 1)).
-   No symbol may be repeated more than three times in a row. Subtraction is used when you would otherwise need to write a symbol more than three times in a row. So the largest number you can write is 3999.

Here's one more example: given  `1464`, return  `"MCDLXIV"`  (1000 + (500 - 100) + 50 + 10 + (5 - 1)).
## My Thoughts
I just had to map the roman numerals. Then subtract as you build the answer.

## Solution (Python)
```python
def to_roman(num):
	roman_map = [
		(1000,  "M"),  (900,  "CM"),
		(500,  "D"),  (400,  "CD"),
		(100,  "C"),  (90,  "XC"),
		(50,  "L"),  (40,  "XL"),
		(10,  "X"),  (9,  "IX"),
		(5,  "V"),  (4,  "IV"),
		(1,  "I")
	]

	result = ""

	for value, symbol in roman_map:
		while num >= value:
			result += symbol
			num -= value

	return result

```
