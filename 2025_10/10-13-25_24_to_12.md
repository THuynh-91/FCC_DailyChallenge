#  24 to 12
## Prompt


Given a string representing a time of the day in the 24-hour format of  `"HHMM"`, return the time in its equivalent 12-hour format of  `"H:MM AM"`  or  `"H:MM PM"`.

-   The given input will always be a four-digit string in 24-hour time format, from  `"0000"`  to  `"2359"`.

## My Thoughts
I just had to turn 24 hour format into 12 hour format. The minutes is easy it stays the same, so just slice the last two. For the hours you just take it and then convert it to AM or PM. 

## Solution (Python)
```python
def to_12(time24):
	hh = int(time24[:2])
	mm = time24[2:]
	
	if hh == 0:
		return f"12:{mm} AM"
	elif hh < 12:
		return f"{hh}:{mm} AM"
	elif hh == 12:
		return f"12:{mm} PM"
	else:
		return f"{hh - 12}:{mm} PM"
```
