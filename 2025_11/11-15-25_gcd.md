# GCD
## Prompt

Given two positive integers, return their greatest common divisor (GCD).

-   The GCD of two integers is the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers without leaving a remainder.

For example, the divisors of  `4`  are  `1`,  `2`, and  `4`. The divisors of  `6`  are  `1`,  `2`,  `3`, and  `6`. So given  `4`  and  `6`, return  `2`, the largest number that appears in both sets of divisors.

## My Thoughts
There is probably a better way to do this, but the first thought was to take the max between the two numbers and increment and check every possible divisor until one fits both of them.

## Solution (Python)
```python
def gcd(x, y):
	temp = max(x,y)
	while temp:
		if x % temp == 0  and y % temp == 0:
			return temp
		temp -= 1
```
