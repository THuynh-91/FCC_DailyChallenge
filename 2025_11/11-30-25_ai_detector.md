# AI Detector
## Prompt
Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following rules:

-   It contains two or more dashes (`-`).
    
-   It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (`()`). Text can be within the parenthesis.
    
-   It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.
    
-   Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (`A-Z`). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.
    

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return  `"AI"`, otherwise, return  `"Human"`.
## My Thoughts
Relatively simple, we just code the rules in. If it has two or more dashes then it's AI. If there are more then two sets of parentheses it's AI. If there are 3 or more words longer then length 7 it's AI.

## Solution (Python)
```python
def detect_ai(text):
	if text.count('-') >= 2:
		return  "AI"

	open_paren = text.count('(')
	close_paren = text.count(')')

	if  min(open_paren, close_paren) >= 2:
		return  "AI"

	cleaned = ''.join(ch if ch.isalpha()  else  ' '  for ch in text)
	words = [w for w in cleaned.split()  if w]
	long_words = sum(1  for w in words if  len(w) >= 7)
	if long_words >= 3:
		return  "AI"
	return  "Human"
```
