# LCM
## Prompt
Given two integers, return the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. For example, given  `4`  and  `6`, return  `12`  because:

-   Multiples of  `4`  are  `4`,  `8`,  `12`  and so on.
-   Multplies of  `6`  are  `6`,  `12`,  `18`  and so on.
-   `12`  is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

## My Thoughts
This is O(n) time, I probably could of done O(logn) if I did something with the GCD. However this works fine for the mean part. Iterate one of the two variables until they are the same. 

## Solution (Python)
```python
def lcm(a, b):
	default_a = a
	default_b = b
	increment_a = 1
	increment_b = 1

	while  True:
		if a == b:
			return a

		if a < b:
			increment_a += 1
			a = default_a * increment_a

		if b < a:
			increment_b += 1
			b = default_b * increment_b
```
