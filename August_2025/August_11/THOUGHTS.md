My first initial thought was to just check if the string had an even length, then split cleanly down the middle; if it had an odd I would take the length, subtract 1 to make it even. Then grab even lengths from the right and left side. Doing so I realized that made the code a bit cluttered and messy. After doing some further thinking I realized I had to do floor division regardless, and it wouldn't have mattered if the string was odd or even as `4//2 = 2` and `5//2 = 2` therefore the first half just grabbed the lower first half, and would remain the same even if it was odd or even; and the second half would be incremented by 1 in length and would fit if the string was odd or even.

From that compare if the vowels in the first half and second half are equal and return that.
